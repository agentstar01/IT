## A little about me 🙋🏽‍♂️

![1691807638964](https://github.com/agentstar01/IT-Portfolio/assets/133976441/1b7a4983-a5dd-49d5-b36a-85898a5e7de0) 

Other than working with technology, I enjoy spending time outdoors and staying active. Some of my favorite activities include hiking, going to the gym, and training mixed martial arts (MMA). I have also recently embraced my artistic side and picked up photography, a skill I'd like to keep honing for years to come. I am also an avid world traveler and my dream is to travel all around the world! Here is a list of countries that I've been to so far: Indonesia, South Korea, Japan, Australia, Fiji, Samoa, American Samoa, Thailand, the U.S.A., Canada, and Singapore. I hope that this list keeps growing as time goes by.
